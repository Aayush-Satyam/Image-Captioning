# Image Captioning Web Application

This repository contains a web application that utilizes the Blip image captioning model to generate accurate and contextually relevant captions for uploaded images. The application is built using the Flask framework and offers a user-friendly interface for easy image captioning.

## Features

### Image upload:
Users can upload their images through the web interface.
### Caption generation:
